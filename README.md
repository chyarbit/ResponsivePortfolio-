# ResponsivePortfolio-

This is a responsive portfolio that demonstrates the understanding of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap concepts.  

It consists of 3 .html files (index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html) that can be navigated to using a collapsible navbar.  There is also a CSS style sheet (index.css) that is used for all .html files.

For styling, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript are used.
